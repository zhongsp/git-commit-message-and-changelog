# Git Commit Message to Changelog

This's inspired by the Angular community.

We'll use a tool named [`Commitizen`](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/),
together with some helper libs.

We should also define some cumtom git commit message guidelines for a project.

## Installation

I'd like to install them locally instead of globally.
If you install them globally, it would be easier to use the tools.

```sh
# main tool
npm install commitizen --save-dev

# choose one `commitizen` adapter
npm install cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev
```
